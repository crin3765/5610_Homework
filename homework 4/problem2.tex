\textbf{Proof}

The cubic interpolant for the given data is $p(x) = x^3$. There are a few ways to see this. The first is to note that an interpolating polynomial is unique. In this case we have the points $(x_i, x_i^3)$. Since $f(x) = x^3$ interpolates the data perfectly, we have that it must be the case that $p(x) = x^3$. Another way to determine this is by using the Lagrange form. Using this method, we get the following:
\begin{align*}
p(x) &= \Sigma_{i = 0}^n x_i^3 L_i(x) \\
&= \frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}{(x_0 - x_1)(x_0 - x_2)(x_0 - x_3)} 
+ \frac{(x - x_0)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)}{(x_1 - x_0)(x_1 - x_2)(x_1 - x_3)} \\
&+ \frac{(x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_3)}{(x_2 - x_0)(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 - x_3)}
+ \frac{(x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}{(x_3 - x_0)(x_3 - x_1)(x_3 - x_2)}
\end{align*}
Expanding and simplifying this yeilds $p(x) = x^3$.

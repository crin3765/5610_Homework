\textbf{Judicious Interpolation} Repeat the above except that you interpolate at the roots of the Chebycheff polynomials.

\textbf{Proof}

Here is the plot of interpolating at the roots of the Chebycheff Polynomials along with the actual graph of $f(x)$.

You can see that the interpolating polynomial is much more accurate by interpolating at the roots of the Chebycheff polynomials than equidistant points.
